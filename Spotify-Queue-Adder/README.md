## Usage

### Run the Script

To run the script, execute the provided batch file or run the Python script directly:

#### Using Batch File

Double-click the `start.bat` file.

#### Directly via Python
``` bash
python app.py
``` 

### Behavior

1.  The script fetches tracks from the specified playlist (`PLAYLIST_URI`).
2.  A random selection of tracks (based on `NUMBER_OF_RANDOM_SONGS`) is added to your Spotify queue.
3.  Optionally, a specific track (`SPECIFIC_SONG_URI`) is added to the queue if `NUMBER_OF_RANDOM_SONGS` is set, not null, or empty.
4.  Tracks will appear in your Spotify app's play queue.

## Notes

-   Ensure the `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` matches the one configured in your Spotify Developer Dashboard.
-   If any issues occur with queuing tracks, the script will print an error message.
